A Rust-based SaaS backend for a Patreon-like crowdfunding platform tailored for content creators in Nepal. The platform allows creators to set up profiles, offer subscription tiers, and receive payments from supporters, with authentication via OAuth 2.0 (Google) and payment integration with Nepal-specific gateways like Khalti and eSewa. The backend uses Actix Web for REST APIs and raw MySQL queries (no ORM) for database interactions.
